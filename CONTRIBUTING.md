# Contributing
Hello! Thank you for wanting to contribute to this Quest. We love contributions. (Isn't Open Source great?)

Please note, all contributors must agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - it keeps things civil and inclusive.  We want to make this a safe place for everyone to make awesome things.

The details of how to contribute to this quest follow.  

## Making Your Own Copy, Then Proposing We Accept Your Changes 
BEcause more than one person might want to edit the quest at the same time, and because we want to make sure all changes fit the aim of the quest we have a slightly indirect process to follow.  The way we ask that you do this is via a fork-and-a-pull request combo. It sounds a little complicated, but it's simple really.  (If you've used github before you can probably skip this section.)

First, click the "Fork" button (top right - you might want to CTRL-click to do this in a new window so you can keep this page open at the same time).  This will make your own personal copy of everything in this quest including this file, linked back to us, it's parent. (Note: to do this you'll need to be logged into your github account. If you don't have one, [sign up](https://github.com/join)! It's free, and easy to get going.)

Once you've forked, you'll probably want to make one or more edits, or add some new files (or even move or delete things).  You can do this in your web browser.  If you're editing a file which ends in ".md" then you need to know "Markdown".  It's [very easy to use](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Once you've made your changes, you can let us know about them, and politely ask that we consider bringing them back in-house.  You do this by creating what is know as a "Pull Request" (as in "here are my proposed changes, would you like to pull them back into your original copy?") To do this, you don't "Save" and instead you "Commit". You can commit to the default ```master``` branch, it's fine.  Then you need to go to the "Pull Requests" tab and click the "New Pull Request" button. Github is clever, and it will see your recent change, and know that you forked from our repo.  It will ask you for a comment (which we'll see so make it helpful) and then you can create the request via another, final green button.

We'll then see the pull request.  We might have a few comments. Please don't be offended if we ask you to make some further changes - we like to keep everything incredibly tidy over here.  It helps less-experienced people contriute too.  please also note we might not accept your changes at all.  We will give you the reason(s) for this.  (Remember, just because we don't want something, others might.  You can just use your copy as your new master copy.)

Once we're happy, we'll "merge" your pull request. That means we'll update our copy of the files with your proposed changes.  Awesome! You're now a contributor.  Thankyou very much!

N.b. you're not obliged to submit PRs.  Feel free to keep your changes to yourself of you like.

## Editing Existing Quest Content
The simplest way to contribute is to edit existing content files.  This all comes from the README.md files.  To make an edit, find the file you want to update in your forked copy, and click the "edit" pencil.  Then follow the instructions again.

## Adding / Updating / Removing Existing Skills
A quest is made up of skills.  Skills are entirely separate things.  Because they are seperate, and have one or more versions, we can pick which ones we want to include in our quests.  After editing quest content, the next most common thing people like to do is 

We use a vaguely-complicated thing called [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage
